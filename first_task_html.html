    Hello everyone!
      
    <br><br>
    My name is Yakir. I'm 24 years old from Netanya.<br>
    This days I'm a student at the CLB for information systems.<br>
    In my free time, I like to play any kind of sports with my friends,
    cook for my family, and hangout in the evenings.<br>
    Currently, I'm looking for my first role in the Israeli high-teck industry.

    Recently, I've been created an NFT project called "Viakavish".<br>
    "Viakavish" is a short animation video brand that my friend created six years ago,<br> and it gained a massive amount of followers and engagements over the years<br> so we decided to transform it into a real business.<br>
   Most people don't know what an NFT is and why people buy it,<br> and the popular opinion in public is that it's a passing trend...<br> So, it might be true, but for now, it's a huge industry that makes a lot of money every day.<br>
  If I could briefly explain what an NFT project is,<br> I would say that it is a "right" to enter a certain community and enjoy its benefits - each project offers its own benefits, and the entrance ticket to the project is actually to purchase its NFT creation.<br><br>
  
  We launched the project one month ago and gained 150,000 shekels in one night.<br> Now we are focused on giving back to the community in several ways,<br> like a platform for our community, collaborations with other NFT projects, merchandise, and more.<br><br>
  
  This was a great journey for me, but I decided to continue and find other interesting projects to do, which hopefully will fit my career goals.<br><br>
  
    We worked on it for something like a year, and I would love to share our social with you-<br><br>
